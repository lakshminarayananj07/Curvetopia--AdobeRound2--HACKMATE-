This project focuses on the regularization of geometric shapes by processing and analyzing data stored in CSV files. The primary objective is to develop a pipeline that reads shape data from CSV files, applies regularization algorithms to standardize and smooth the shapes, and outputs the refined shapes for further analysis or visualization.
